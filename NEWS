argparse4j 0.7.0
================

Release Note
------------

This release adds several new functionalists.
ArgumentParser#parseKnownArgs() family methods were added to parse
known arguments only.  Metavar for Boolean and Enum types are now
automatically generated if neither Argument#metavar() nor
Argument#choices() is used.  To achieve this, MetavarInference
interface, which is part of public API, was added for the underlying
mechanism.  The BooleanArgumentType and its helper method
Arguments#booleanType() were added for strict boolean parameter
handling.  Previously, when parsing concatenated short options, the
default prefix character ("-") is used, regardless of the prefix
characters given by application.  Now it is corrected, and the prefix
characters given by application are used for this purpose.

Changes
-------

* Add BooleanArgumentType for strict boolean value conversion

* Infer metavar for enums

  Previously, when enum types is used as type, either with
  ReflectArgumentType or EnumStringArgumentType, application had to
  set metavar to show their available values.  With this commit,
  metavar is automatically created using MetavarInference interface.

* Introduce MetavarInference interface, and infer Boolean metavar

  Previously, when Boolean.class is passed to Argument#type(), and no
  metavar is provided, the help message was like "-f F".  This is
  intentional, and expected, but it is better for user to show them F
  is true or false.  This commit introduce MetavarInference interface.
  When sub class of ArgumentType also implements MetavarInference, it
  can infer metavar from its interface.  We made ReflectArgumentType
  implement this interface, and if Boolean.class is given for its
  constructor, then return useful Boolean value metavar from
  inferMetavar() method.

* Add ArgumentParser#parseKnownArgs() to parse known arguments only

  If a parameter, named unknown, is given, all unrecognized arguments
  are stored in it.  This parsing operation does not work in all cases
  as you expect.  In particular, if variable length positional
  arguments (nargs("*") or nargs("+")), all non-prefixed arguments are
  consumed.

* Use prefixChars to parse concatenated short options
